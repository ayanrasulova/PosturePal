        <p class="about-us-description poppins-regular">Incorporate these exercises and stretches into your routine to improve posture and relieve tension:</p>
        <ul class="about-us-description poppins-regular">
            <li><strong>Chin Tucks</strong>: Strengthen neck and upper back muscles by gently tucking your chin towards your chest while sitting upright. Hold for 2-3 seconds; repeat 15 times for 2 sets.</li>
            <li><strong>Wall Angels</strong>: Stand against a wall, raise your arms to shoulder height, and move them up and down while keeping contact with the wall. This strengthens upper back and shoulder muscles.</li>
            <li><strong>Cat-Cow Stretch</strong>: Alternate between arching and rounding your back on hands and knees to increase spinal flexibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Chest Stretch</strong>: Interlace your fingers behind your back, straighten your arms, and lift them away from your body. Hold for 30 seconds to counteract forward-rounded shoulders.</li>
            <li><strong>Hip Flexor Stretch</strong>: Release tension in the hips by lunging forward with one leg while keeping the other knee on the ground. Hold for 30 seconds per side.</li>
        </ul>
